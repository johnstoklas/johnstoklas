# John Stoklas

## üëã About Me
Hi! I'm John Stoklas, an aspiring full-stack developer and a double major in computer science/business at Trinity University. I'm currently leading backend development on an exciting new mobile app project and am conducting research this summer focusing on data visualization! I am drawn to projects that focus heavily on the user experience, as seen in my projects, such as my shopping cart extension, BuyHive, and my AI health predictor, StressSaver. Right now, I'm honing my skills in Agile development and deepening my expertise in cloud computing with Azure.

## üöÄ Projects
### 1. üêù [BuyHive Chrome Extension](https://github.com/johnstoklas/buy-hive)
BuyHive is an AI-powered shopping cart that utilizes web scraping to reduce clutter between websites. The Chrome extension condenses all of your shopping into one cart, improving shopping efficiency and removing the hassle of having to keep track of where all your items are!
- **Technologies Used**: React, JavaScript, Chrome APIs, Auth0, Babel
- **Features**:
  - User Authentication: Implemented secure user login using Auth0 and stored session data with Chrome Extension APIs for personalized, seamless user experiences.
  - Adding Items: Scraped product details like price, title, and image using AI models and stored organized user data in MongoDB via middleware in background.js.
  - Folder Organization: Managed real-time folder updates with React‚Äôs useState and Virtual DOM, making local changes to reduce server interactions.
  - Item Management: Enabled inline-editing and real-time actions for item updates, deletions, and organization with React hooks.
  - Email Sharing: Streamlined sharing by allowing users to email folders directly, reducing the need to send multiple links.
  - Popup and Click Handling: Used useRef and global variables to optimize space and control pop-ups, minimizing distractions with click-to-dismiss functionality.

### 2. [StressSaver AI](https://github.com/johnstoklas/rowdy-hacks-2024)
Attended RowdyHacks 2024 where my friends and I built a website where users enter simple, trackable data like step count, heart rate, and hours of sleep. Users receive scores for their health, and a Tensor Flow model predicts stress while OpenAI gives suggestions for how to improve it.
- **Technologies Used**: React, MongoDB, TensorFlow, OpenAI JavaScript, Node.js, SCSS
- **Features**:
  - Built the front end of the project using React, we created a log-in page, an input page, and a profile page
  -	Trained a machine learning model to understand data about how step count, heart rate, and sleep can affect stress, we then sent the user‚Äôs cumulative data, stored in a database using MongoDB, to Open AI where it would output recommendations for the user
  -	Learned how to collaborate on a full stack project, connecting components from the front and back end, making sure to keep track of Git Versions
    
### 3. [Movie Match-Up](https://github.com/johnstoklas/movie-guesser)
A multiplayer web-based game where two players face off to see who can get 10 movies in chronological release order based on movie frames.
- **Technologies Used**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js (Socket.io), TMDB API, Heroku	
- **Features**:
  - Integrated TMDB API to store movie data for the game, streamlining the process of retrieving and displaying relevant information for players, to make a more enjoyable user experience for players
  - Worked with Node.js to improve my back-end skills and built front-end user interface with HTML and CSS

### 4. [Exercise Tracker](https://github.com/johnstoklas/training-log-app)
A website that allows a user to log-in and document their workouts by allowing them to log what they did, when they did it, how difficult it was, and their mood
- **Technologies Used**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js (Socket.io), MongoDB
- **Features**:
  -	Their workouts were stored in a database, using MongoDB, furthering my back-end skills with Node.js

### 5. [Discord Weather Bot](https://github.com/johnstoklas/discord-weather-bot)
A discord bot that, when called, can give the user access to specific weather conditions in an area
- **Technologies Used**: JavaScript, Discord.js, Tomorrow.io API, QuickChart.io API
- **Features**:
  -	This project improved my back-end skills by working with Discord to send data that the user inputs to the bot
  -	The bot then inputs the data into the Tomorrow.io API to fetch the weather which is then sent to the QuickChart.io API to convert that data into a graph which is then sent back with improved readability and visualization for the user
